# The-Art-of-Computer-Programming
A repository to house my notes and code as I (try to) work through Donald Knuth's monolithic books.

## What?

This is going to be a (more or less) complete collection of my notes, thoughts, and solutions as I work my way through Donald Knuth's [The Art of Computer Programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Art_of_Computer_Programming).

## Why?

Creating a public-facing collection of my progress seemed like the best way for me to attempt to keep myself accountable for the work I'm doing. This also allows people to follow along if they wish as I try to work my way through. Once I start writing solutions to the exercices in the books, I am also interested in hearing people's opinions on my code. Of course, I will be looking at the "answer code" in the book, but I also welcome any constructive criticism/comments on my code. 

Also, since this is a book that lends itself well to being re-read and revisited regularly, I will have a (hopefully well-organized) collection of notes and code to refer back to.

## How?

This repo is going to be structured fairly clearly, with a root folder for each volume, then a folder for each chapter, and then notes and exercises folders, that will contain numbered .md files for notes, and files with my solutions to the exercises (which will also likely include the original exercise description, and the provided solution in the book. 

## What if you give up on reading this book?

Then this repository will stand as a testament to my failure. :)

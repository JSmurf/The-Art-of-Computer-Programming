## What is this?

Chapter 0 clearly doesn't exist in this book, so what is this?

This is a place for my general notes about where I am each time I start reading this book.

If I stop reading for a bit, and then I decide to start reading again, this is where I will write my notes about how I got here, and what I'm hoping to do. Each time I start, I'll read over my previous notes.

## Where am I?

I have a semi-decent understanding of Computer Science. I have worked through a good portion of the Harvard CS50X course, and while I've struggled through many of the projects, I do have a basic understanding of many of the important concepts.

At the moment, I am also working my way through the Nand2Tetris course/book, which is helping me to understand how computers are built. I am hoping that these two books greatly improve my understanding of programming and Computer Science.

I also would like to note that I've always been a fan of Math, and can generally pick up on new concepts fairly easily. That being said, I also haven't taken a math course in several years, so there is a lot for me to learn. I know that these books are fairly math-heavy, so I look forward to learning a lot, and getting stuck often.

## Am I a good programmer?

That's the biggest question here, right? What drew me to this book the most was Bill Gates' quote about how you should read this if you think you're a great programmer, and send him your resume if you can read the whole thing. 

I don't know that I am a good programmer though. I wouldn't really say that I am. But hopefully by the next time I start this book, I will feel that I have improved at least somewhat.
